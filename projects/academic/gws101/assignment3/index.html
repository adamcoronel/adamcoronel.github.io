            The way Americans have viewed abortion has changed drastically over time. 
            In the eighteenth century, colonists cared little about intervening in the practice, 
            however we know that abortions were still somewhat commonplace at this time.
            <blockquote>
                It reveals that many [people] were familiar with the idea of abortion, 
                the case supports historians' that abortion attempts were far 
                from rare in colonial America.

            </blockquote>
            While abortions were not rare, it is still rather unsure how exactly American society 
            viewed abortion at this time. This is due to little historical notes on the matter, 
            with many such abortions being viewed as simply “restoring the regular menstrual cycle.”
            However, we can imply that early America did not put much pressure on actually regulating 
            the practice legally and tended to shy away from the practice in both a doctoral and 
            historical sense. Therefore, those who participated in abortion at this time mostly
            seemed to be unmarried women and the people performing these abortions were hack doctors of 
            sorts with no real formal training.
        </p>
        <p>
            As history progressed, American society's view of abortion changed over time. 
            Married women were discovered to be having abortions at higher rates. Moreover,
            there was a shift of perspective on how safe an abortion should be. 
            Expensive commercial doctors were favored instead of hack doctors. 

            <blockquote>
                Abortion entered the mainstream media of American Life during the middle 
                ages of the nineteenth century. While the unmarried and the socially desperate 
                continued to have… [abortions]... it also became highly visible, much more 
                frequently practiced, and quite common as a means of family limitation among white,
                Protestant, native-born wives of middle- and upper-class standing.

            </blockquote>

            After the civil war, abortion became illegal. 
            This sparked huge arguments about abortion between Feminists and Anti-Feminists, 
            leading up to the Great Depression and now where abortion continues to be a heated 
            topic of discussion in modern society.

            Reproductive Justice

            One of the movements spawned from the topic of abortion and reproductive rights is 
            the movement for Reproductive Justice. Reproductive Justice is the movement that 
            demands sexual autonomy and gender freedom for every human. 
            It's also known as a “human-first” movement. 
            Reproductive Justice is also defined as a framework that applies 
            the following core principles and tenants:
            <blockquote>
                Every women has the human right to:
                <li>
                    Decide if and when she will have a baby and the conditions under 
                    which she will give birth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Decide if she will not have a baby and her options for preventing or ending a pregnancy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Parent the children she already has with the necessary 
                    social support in safe environments and healthy communities, and without fear of violence from individuals or the government.
                </li>

            These tenants can also be found on the 
            <a href="https://www.sistersong.net/">SisterSong website</a>, 
            which is a great example of the Reproductive Justice movement being 
            deployed as a movement framework, where their purpose is to build 
            these safe communities that are said to be necessary.

            Sexual Violence
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sexual Violence has historically been targeted to those who are not the norm. 
            Whether that be women of color or women of lower socioeconomic status, 
            sexual violence has been especially prevalant in these cases. 
            This is assumed to have happened because in early U.S. history, 
            those in power strategically avoided classifying sexual violence 
            against certain individuals as just that, and instead pointed to it 
            being about sexual violence against women as a whole.
            <blockquote>
                In the end, the assumed race and class neutrality of gender violence 
                led to the erasure of low-income women and women of color from the dominant view. 
                I contend that this erasure, in turn, seriously compromised the transgressive and 
                transformative potential of the antiviolence movement's potentially radical critique 
                of various forms of social domination. It divorced racism from sexism, for example, 
                and invited a discourse regarding gender violence without attention to the class 
                dimensions of patriarchy and white domination in this country.

                <cite>Beth Richie. A Black Feminist Reflection on the Antiviolence Movement. p. 1135.</cite>
            </blockquote>
            Furthermore, sexual violence against those not in the norm has a long history of 
            being unpunished in U.S. history. So much so, that the first time men were actually 
            punished for sexual violence against a black women was made into a national case, 
            where the verdict was hard fought and yet barely achieved. However, 
            this Tallahassee case leads to a hopeful future, where we are just 
            starting to see the achievements of this case.

            Carceral Feminism vs. Abolitionist Feminism
        </h2>
        <p>
            Carceral and Abolitionist Feminism are both approaches of feminism that 
            focus on gender-based violence.
            <br>
            <br>
            Carceral Feminism is an approach of feminism that relies on increased policing and imprisonment to be the leading force that tackles gender-based violence. We can see this in action, where Carceral Feminism was used against Cherie Williams ineffectively, and actually caused more problems than it should've. 
            <blockquote>
                Cherie Williams…just wanted to protect herself from her abusive boyfriend. So she called the cops. But although New York requires police to make an arrest when responding to domestic violence calls, the officers did not leave their car. When Williams demanded their badge numbers, the police handcuffed her, drove her to a deserted parking lot, and beat her, breaking her nose and jaw, and rupturing her spleen. They then left her on the ground.
                <br>
                <cite>Victoria Law. Against Carceral Feminism.</cite>
            </blockquote>
            Carceral feminism often overlooks how the criminal justice system responds and commits acts of violence. In contrast, abolitionist feminism seeks to dismantle oppressive systems, including the criminal justice system. Abolitionist feminism also advocates for alternatives of policing so that the above situation does not happen, and they advocate for healing and accountability for survivors of gender-based violence.
