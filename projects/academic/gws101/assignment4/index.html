            The Israel-Palestine conflict is about two groups of people who claim the same land. A common myth is that this conflict goes back centuries, but the conflict only goes back to around a hundred years ago, in the early 1900s. Back then, this region along the eastern Mediterranean had been under Ottoman rule for centuries prior. This region was religiously diverse, including mostly Muslims and Christians but also a small number of Jews. These groups of people were generally peaceful towards each other under Ottoman rule. As time went on, Arab people in this region began to develop a sense of identity: Palestinians. Furthermore, in Europe more and more Jews were joining a movement called Zionism. Zionists believed that Judaism was not just a religion, but a nationality, and it deserved a nation of its own. They believed that this nation should be where their historic homeland resides, the very same region being discussed. Many thousands of English Jews moved into the region following this belief in the early 20th century <cite>(Vox)</cite>.

        <p>
            After World War One, the Ottoman Empire Collapsed. The British and French empires drew up borders for the Middle East, and the British empire took over the region that it called “The British Mandate for Palestine.” Tensions rose in this newly formed region, where both Jews and Arabs fought against each other and towards the British while they tried to establish who owned what in this newly formed territory. Then came World War Two, leading thousands of Jews to flee towards British Palestine as the events of the Holocaust unfolded. In 1947, the newly formed United Nations formed a plan to divide British Palestine into two separate states: Israel and Palestine. Israel was deemed to be the home for the Jews while Palestine was deemed to be the home for the Arabs. The holy city of Jerusalem was deemed to be an international zone of peace for all parties. After this plan, the British left as they could no longer control the rising tensions of the two newly formed states.

            The Jews accepted the plan and declared Independence as Israel. But the Arabs throughout the region saw the UN plan are more European colonialism trying to steal their land. Many of the Arab states, declared war on Israel to try establishing a unified Arab Palestine. Israel ended up winning the war, and they pushed the borders way farther then what was declared by the UN plan. Israel took control of all the Arab territory except for Gaza and the West Bank. This is the beginning of the Israel-Palestine Conflict that still goes on today.

            Palestine Is a Feminist Issue
        </h2>
        <p>
            Today, violence and genocide are rampant in this region. Gaza and the West Bank have been occupied by Israel since 1976. Gaza, a small strip of land only 25 miles long and 7.5 miles wide, is now home to over 2 million Palestinians. This strip has become one of the most densely populated areas in the world. For the last two decades, Palestinians have been living in a blockade that allows Israel to control the flow of essential supplies <cite>(Vox)</cite>. On some checkpoints, Palestinian women are forced to give birth to children because they are now allowed to move freely. Furthermore, women are harshly targeted simply for being a woman. However, what is most disturbing is the Israeli usage of the word “pinkwashing.” 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Over a decade ago, Palestinian activists adopted the term “pinkwashing” to describe how the Israeli state and its supporters use the language of gay and trans rights to direct international attention away from the oppression of Palestinians… Pinkwashing pushes the racist idea that sexual and gender diversity are unnatural and foreign to Palestinian society. When this idea is internalized within Palestinian communities, it alienates queer and gender non-conforming Palestinians and isolates them as a social group. These compounding social pressures tell queer Palestinians that they must give up on some part of their identity or experience: we can either be queer and not accepted as a Palestinian, or we can be Palestinian and not accepted as queer.
            <br>

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This usage of “pinkwashing” clearly identifies and highlights why and how Palestine is also a feminist issue. It is up to feminists to show their strong disapproval for this practice and to highlight why and how this is wrong. It is of the upmost importance that people show their support for those suffering. 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            To our Palestinian sisters, your steadfastness to hold ground, at the risk of injury and death, and against all odds is our fortitude. Gendered violence is core to settler colonial practice. We stand with you as you resist this masculinized and militarized colonization. We share in your pain from this renewed assault on Palestinian life and land. We are enraged as settlers wreak havoc and call for the death of our people. We stand vigilant as you withstand airstrikes in Gaza, and stun grenades, tear gas, skunk water, rubber bullets, and the desecration of our sacred sites in Jerusalem, no less during the month of Ramadan. We stand with you as you resist the media's violent erasure of the Palestinian struggle.

        <p>
            As a reminder, it is important to remember that there are many ways to help those in need. As said by feminists in Palestine: "We are not asking you for heroic action or to form freedom brigades. We are simply asking you not to be complicit in perpetuating the crimes of the Israeli state." <cite>(Jadaliyya Reports et al.)</cite>

            Immigration Is a Feminist Issue

            Women and their children make up about three-quarters of the yearly migrants to the United States. Despite this, the immigration system often fails to uphold their rights. Currently, around four million individuals are awaiting family reunification due to severe backlogs. Many are enduring waits that can span decades. Additionally, LGBTQ+ immigrants are unable to sponsor their partners or children despite being equal to those who are not a part of this community.
        </p>
        <p>
            A significant portion of undocumented women, approximately 60 percent, participate in the labor force, often in informal or contingent roles such as caregiving or service industries. Their undocumented status exposes them to exploitation and abuse, especially in work environments.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            We need an immigration process that treats women fairly and humanely and recognizes the value of their contributions to the U.S. economy and society. Until we create a common-sense immigration process, we cannot justify enforcing the mix of outdated and unworkable laws on our books.

            Critiques of the Prison System
        </h2>
        <p>
            Two million people are currently locked up in U.S. prisons and jails. More than 70 percent of the imprisoned population are people of color. However, it is hardly acknowledged that the fastest growing group of prisoners are black women and that Native American prisoners are the largest group per capita <cite>("Masked Racism: Reflections on the Prison Industrial Complex")</cite>. Most of these people are victims of the Prison Industrial Complex (PIC). 
        </p>
        <p>
            The PIC is a term used to describe the overlapping interests of the government and the industries that involve prisons. This implies that State and Private interests overlap, which is the reason we see such a big uptick of people in jail. Abolitionists seek to tear down these prisons and jails to make prison work towards a goal of rehabilitation, and not incarceration.

            The Theory of Intersectionality
        </h2>
        <p>
            Most people are and will be disadvantaged because of one factor or another.  Intersectionality hopes to highlight that different combinations of people will face different issues than others.
We can intersectionality in action when looking at Palestine. Palestinian feminists navigate multiple layers of oppression and discrimination based on multiple factors, especially for their religion and occupation. Palestinian feminists emphasize that women's freedom and their nation's freedom go hand in hand. They push for feminist actions that focus on the voices and experiences of marginalized groups like Palestinian women, LGBTQ+ people, refugees, and those living under occupation.
