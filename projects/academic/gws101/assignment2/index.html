            Patriarchal Dominance as a Structural Issue

        <p>
            Patriarchal culture is deeply embedded in almost every area of human existence. 
            We as a society participate in this patriarchy, whether we like to or not,
            because the patriarchy is a structural issue.
            <blockquote>
                At its core, patriarchy is... about humanity, with manhood and
                masculinity most closely associated with being human and womanhood and
                femininity related to the marginal position of "other."
                <br>
                <cite>Allan G. Johnson. Patriarchy, the System.</cite>
            </blockquote>
            Social relationships and the normativity of men being the dominant power
            contribute highly to the structure we have now. "Structure" in this sense, is defined
            by ways that gender privilege and oppression contribute to unequal rights and fairness
            for others. Because manhood being the dominant power is the normal, we create
            an uequal fighting ground where anybody other than what's viewed as normal will
            always lose.

            Intersectionality and Systems of Power

        <p>
            As discussed earlier, patriarchy favors those who are the dominant power.
            However, the reality is that most people are and will be disadvantaged
            because of one factor or another.
            <blockquote>
                Intersectionality was initially conceived as a way to present a simple reality...
                that disadvantage or exclusion can be based on the interaction of multiple 
                factors rather than just one.
                <br>
                <cite>African American Policy Forum. “A Primer on Intersectionality.”</cite>
            </blockquote>
            The law impacts people differently based on their differing experiences and identities.
            The systems of power dictate that those who possess qualities that are lower
            on the social hierarchy will be treated unfairly. Intersectionality
            hopes to highlight that different combinations of people will face different issues
            than others, and that we as a society must pay attention to the those intersections.

            Masculinity as a Social Construct
        </h2>
        <p>
            Masculinity is a social construct. Many have defined masculinity as
            the way in which men act in accordance to the normative patriarchy. However,
            this definition weakens society and fails to highlight those who don't fall
            into this definition. Therefore, what arrived was a model of "multiple masculinities."
            <blockquote>
                Men enact and embody different configurations of masculinity depending on their 
                positions within a social hierarchy of power.
                <br>
                <cite>Pascoe. Dude, You're a Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School.</cite>
            </blockquote>
            This model shows that men too fall under the guise of Intersectionality, where
            depending where on the hierarchy they fall they have wildly different forms
            of masculinity.

            White Privilege and Male Privilege 
        </h2>
        <p>
            We live in a white patriarchy. That means that those with power have the
            ability to control others, even if unconsciously. More specifically,
            this manifests itself in white and male privilege. Furthermore, those in power
            are carefully thought not to pay attention to their privilege.
            Privilege comes in many ways.
            <blockquote>
                I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets 
                that I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was "meant" to 
                remain oblivious. White privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of 
                special provisions, assurances, tools, maps, guides, codebooks, passports, visas, 
                clothes, compass, emergency gear, and blank checks.
                <br>
                <cite>McIntosh, Peggy. White Privilege and Male Privilege.</cite>
            </blockquote>
            Privilege presents itself in all facets of life, and it is because of this
            that many who benefit from it believe it to be the right way to live.
            However, those on the other side lament the fact that they must work exponentially harder
            just to be at the same starting line.

            Seeing One's Self

            The ability to see one's self in the systems of power and being able to understand
            why you do or don't have privilege is an invaluable lesson to be learned.
            You cannot choose how you are born, you only just are. Because of this, you
            are able to choose whether or not to try and change the patriarchy, as shown in
            the cycle of socialization above. It does not matter where you were placed in the
            patriarchy. If you struggle at all, then you can connect with others and strive
            for change.
            <blockquote>
                There is a special tie binding people together who struggle
                collectively for liberation.
